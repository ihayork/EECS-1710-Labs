I do not own the image used in this program. The image rights belong to OMOCAT, taken from their video game "OMORI."

The instructions are clear in the program itself, there's text in the frame that tells you what to do.

The upper left quadrant holds the original image, 
upper right is sorted by hue, 
lower right is sorted by saturation, 
and lower left is sorted by brightness.

I recommend you try different patterns with your mouse, to see how it changes the order in which the dots move to their next positions.
