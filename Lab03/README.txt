HOW TO NAVIGATE:

The clock may seem intimidating upon first glance. 
The hour, minute and second hands are split and there are several clock faces stacked upon each other.
The second hand is the furthest from the center.
The minute hand is the next furthest from the center.
The hour hand is connected to the center.

The progress bars on either side of the clock face represent the amount of time progressed.
The left bar represents how much time has passed during the current hour.
The right bar represents how much time has passed during the current minute.
